            <h1>DESCRIPTION OF PLACE:A Perfect Whole</h1>
            <p>The 200 foot cedar and hemlock trees extend,trying to reach the sky.We stop the car.Get out.Everything is covered in moss.Giant,green ferns  and mushrooms are everywhere11.It smells of fresh rain and soil.Nearby I hear the soft trickling of a creek.The forest and the fog compliment each other.The remaining fog swirls in spirals within  the rays of sunlight.</p>
